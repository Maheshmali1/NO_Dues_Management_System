# NO_Dues_Management_System

# Tech Stack : C++ | OOPs | STL | CLI
- The "No Dues Management System for Institutes" project is a software application designed using the object-oriented programming language C++. 
It aims to provide a hassle-free process for managing the final no dues clearance of students from an educational institute.

- The system has various functionalities such as adding new students, displaying information about all present students, 
getting particular student information, and adding dues on particular students with reasons such as library, infrastructure, and laboratories.

- To implement the student information, a class is created with fields such as full name, roll number, class name, laboratory due, library due, infrastructure due, and their respective reasons. 
This class helps in organizing the student data in a structured and efficient manner, making it easier to manage.

- The system enables the institute to keep track of all the dues of the students and helps in identifying the students who have outstanding dues. 
It simplifies the final no dues clearance process, thereby making it more convenient for both the students and the institute.

- Overall, the No Dues Management System for Institutes using C++ is a useful software application that streamlines the no dues clearance process and helps in maintaining accurate student data,
reducing errors and improving the efficiency of the institute's administrative tasks.
